🌟 Highlights

- 🚛 Simulation of truck movements from gate entry to weighbridge processing  
- ⚙️ Queueing logic and congestion visualization using real operational behavior  
- 🧮 Developed entirely in **Python 3.13.2** for precision and reproducibility  
- 💡 Built and tested in a **Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`)** for interactive experimentation  
- 🔍 Easily adaptable to your own dataset for testing and validation

ℹ️ Overview

This project presents a discrete-event simulation of truck flow inside a terminal environment, modeled in Python.
It reproduces queue dynamics, weighbridge processing, and congestion propagation between operational zones.

The simulation aims to support process optimization, bottleneck analysis, and decision-making in logistics systems.

Using a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) provides several benefits:
	•	You can visualize intermediate results (queues, delays, bottlenecks) step by step.
	•	It enables fast iteration and debugging during model design.
	•	It’s ideal for educational or research presentations, where explanations and outputs coexist.

👉 Tip: To see the moving circle (the simulated truck or “bubble”) clearly, press Start, then Reset, and Start again. This refreshes the animation and ensures smooth visualization.
